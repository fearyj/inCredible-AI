PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design a platform or app with AI to counter the proliferation of online falsehoods. Possible areas include, but are not limited to:
1. LLMs for Online Misinformation
2. Image/Video Deepfake Detection
3. Automated Fact-Checking
4. Explainable Fact-Checking

Judging Criteria:
40% Technical Difficulty (Knowledge of Software Functions, In-depth Research)
30% Industrial Value (Community Impact, Feasibility)
20% Innovation (Improve gaps in existing measures, Different from existing solutions)
10% Design Aesthetics (UI & Demo Video is creative & aesthetically pleasing)

Key: Novelty

Draft Ideas:
- S3 to store user feedback on the output we generated, then use the feedback to inform other user of users feedback. (User can agree or disagree and maybe give comments)
- Hugging face got inference api for text misinformation detection (Try to pair with what grok does which is learn from X)
- Deepfake can try deepware scanner (still beta V1) api, 
- Fact check can use wikipedia api and claimreview data (Use llm to reason over result)
- Generate guide on how to identify fake information
- Feed user with correct information
- Detect how many percent is fake
- Get credibility score of the output
- Display list of souces and their credibility score
- Filter and summarise from sources that have credibility score of 80% above, take top 3 website and summarise into a complete information
- For deepfake, summary of why it is fake must be generated
- See whether we can use reasoning models like deepseek
- Use AI to produce image of what an actual image should look like
- Multi layer verification (2fa for facts)
- Use reasoning to produce a likelyhood of how much something would happen
- Peng Yee suggest create something for users to upload evidence regarding misinformation of themselves to clear their name
- Simple UI, monotone (Black, Gray, White) or kanban detection style (if have time)


-Simple page with few different tab with different function: 
1) First page is user prompt the AI, like LLM to fact check something
2) Second page is deepfake, User upload an image
3) News page screenshot, user provide screenshot of a news page or a post, then the AI will return with fact check and also return a 4-part story illustration of what are the motives of the misinformation


Tech Stack:
Frontend: React
Backend: Flask
Storage: AWS S3
Host: AWS EC2
AIs: Deepware for deepfake, Hugging face APi for text misinformation, see how to implement take social media texts like Grok, Gemini, need find text to image llm, replicate ai

SQLAlchemy to store userfeedback, wikipediaapi
